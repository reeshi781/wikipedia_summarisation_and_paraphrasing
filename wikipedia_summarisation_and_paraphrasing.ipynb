Born to a Muslim father and Hindu mother on 27 December 1965, Khan was brought up in both faiths. In 1981, when Salim married the actress Helen, the children's relationship with their father grew hostile and only recovered years later.Salman Khan's paternal great-grandparents are believed to be Alakozai Pashtuns from Afghanistan who immigrated to Indore State, Indore Residency (now in Madhya Pradesh), British India in the mid-1800s; however, Jasim Khan in his biography of the actor states that his ancestors belonged to the Akuzai sub-tribe of the Yusufzai Pashtuns from Malakand in the Swat valley of North-West Frontier Province, British India (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan). His grandfather Abdul Rashid Khan was a Deputy Inspector General of the Indore state who was awarded the Diler Jung award of the Holkar times. Khan's mother is a homemaker, whose father Baldev Singh Charak, a Dogra Rajput, comes from Jammu in Jammu and Kashmir and whose Marathi mother comes from Maharashtra. Khan can also speak Marathi, in addition to Hindi and English. He has two brothers, Arbaaz Khan and Sohail Khan; and two sisters, Alvira Khan Agnihotri, who is married to actor/director Atul Agnihotri, and an adopted sister Arpita.Salman finished his schooling at St. Stanislaus High School in Bandra, Mumbai, as did his younger brothers Arbaaz and Sohail. Previously, he studied at The Scindia School in Gwalior for a few years along with his younger brother Arbaaz. He attended St. Xavier's College in Mumbai but dropped out.\n",

      "Abdul Rashid Salim Salman Khan, also known as Salman Khan, was born on December 27, 1965, to his Muslim father, Salim Khan, and his Hindu mother, Sushila Charak. Raised in both faiths, Khan's relationship with his father became strained after his second marriage to actress Helen in 1981, but they eventually reconciled. Khan's ancestors were believed to be Alakozai Pashtuns from Afghanistan who immigrated to Indore State, India, in the mid-1800s. Another account suggests that his ancestors belonged to the Akuzai sub-tribe of the Yusufzai Pashtuns from Malakand in present-day Pakistan. Khan's grandfather, Abdul Rashid Khan, was a Deputy Inspector General in Indore state. His mother, a homemaker, comes from a Dogra Rajput family from Jammu and Kashmir, with Marathi roots. Khan can speak Hindi, English, and Marathi. He has two brothers, Arbaaz Khan and Sohail Khan, and two sisters, Alvira Khan Agnihotri and an adopted sister named Arpita.

      "Salman Khan, born on December 27, 1965, is the eldest son of screenwriter Salim Khan and his first wife, Salma Khan (formerly known as Sushila Charak). Salman grew up in a blended family, with both Hindu and Muslim influences. It is believed that his paternal great-grandparents were Alakozai Pashtuns from Afghanistan, who migrated to Indore State, British India in the 1800s. However, there are differing opinions, with some claiming that his ancestors belong to the Akuzai sub-tribe of the Yusufzai Pashtuns from present-day Pakistan. His grandfather, Abdul Rashid Khan, held the position of Deputy Inspector General of the Indore state. Salman's mother comes from a Dogra Rajput father from Jammu and a Marathi mother from Maharashtra. He is fluent in Hindi, English, and Marathi. Salman has two brothers, Arbaaz and Sohail, and two sisters, Alvira and adopted sister Arpita. He attended St. Stanislaus High School in Mumbai and briefly studied at The Scindia School in Gwalior.
