His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before. Born prematurely, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug. When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough (nÃ©e Blythe). Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: \"Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them.\" Newton's mother had three children (Mary, Benjamin, and Hannah) from her second marriage.\n",

      "Isaac Newton, the famous scientist, was born on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642, in Woolsthorpe Manor, Lincolnshire. His father had passed away a few months prior to his birth. Newton was a tiny child and was considered premature. When he was just three years old, his mother married Reverend Barnabas Smith and left Newton in the care of his grandmother. Newton developed a dislike for his stepfather and held some resentment towards his mother for marrying him. In a list of sins that he kept, he mentioned threatening to burn his parents and their house. Newton's mother went on to have three children from her second marriage.\n",

      "Isaac Newton, who was born on Christmas Day in 1642 (according to the modern calendar), had a difficult early life. He was born prematurely in Woolsthorpe Manor, Lincolnshire, following the death of his father, also Isaac Newton, three months earlier. His mother, Hannah Ayscough, later remarried and left Newton to be raised by his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. Newton developed a strong dislike for his stepfather and held some resentment towards his mother for remarrying. This was evident in a list of sins he compiled when he was 19. Meanwhile, his mother went on to have three children with her new husband. Despite these challenges, Newton would go on to become one of the most significant scientists and mathematicians in history.\n",
